Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.
They allow Python to execute certain blocks of code only if a condition is true.

Python uses three main conditional structures:

if

if–else

if–elif–else
_____________>
1. if Statement

Used when you want to run a block of code only if a condition is true.

Syntax
if condition:
    statement(s)

Example
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")

2. if–else Statement

Used when you need two possible outcomes.

Syntax
if condition:
    statement(s)
else:
    statement(s)

Example
marks = 45

if marks >= 50:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")

3. if–elif–else Statement

Used when you have multiple conditions to check.

Syntax
if condition1:
    statement(s)
elif condition2:
    statement(s)
elif condition3:
    statement(s)
else:
    statement(s)

Example
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade C")
else:
    print("Grade D")

IMPORTANT NOTES
✔ Conditions must be boolean expressions

Example: x > 5, name == "Alex"

✔ Indentation is mandatory in Python

Python uses 4 spaces (or 1 tab) to define blocks.

✔ You can have multiple elif, but only one else.
4. Nested if Statements

An if inside another if.

Example
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    if age >= 60:
        print("Senior Citizen")
    else:
        print("Adult")

5. Using Logical Operators in Conditions
Example with and
age = 16

if age >= 13 and age < 18:
    print("Teenager")

Example with or
color = "red"

if color == "red" or color == "blue":
    print("Primary color")

Example with not
x = 5

if not x == 10:
    print("x is not 10")

6. Short-Hand (One-Line) if
Basic one-line if
a = 5
if a > 0: print("Positive number")

One-line if–else (ternary)
age = 18
msg = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(msg)

7. Combining Comparisons (Chained Conditions)

Python allows comparison chaining:

x = 10

if 5 < x < 20:
    print("x is between 5 and 20")
