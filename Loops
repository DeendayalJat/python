Loops in Python are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Python has two main types of loops:

for loop

while loop

And also two control statements:

break

continue

pass
____________+++++++++++++++++++__________________________________
1. for LOOP

Used when you want to repeat code a specific number of times or iterate through items.

Basic Syntax
for variable in sequence:
    statement(s)


A sequence can be a list, string, tuple, dictionary, or a range.

A) For Loop with range()

range() generates a sequence of numbers.

for i in range(5):
    print(i)


Output:

0 1 2 3 4

Common range() Forms
Expression	Meaning
range(n)	0 to n-1
range(start, end)	start to end-1
range(start, end, step)	step = increment/decrement
Example
for i in range(1, 11, 2):
    print(i)

B) Looping Through a List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for f in fruits:
    print(f)

C) Looping Through a String
for ch in "hello":
    print(ch)

D) Looping Through a Dictionary
student = {"name": "Alex", "age": 15}

for key in student:
    print(key, student[key])

2. while LOOP

Used when the number of repetitions is not known in advance.
It runs as long as the condition is True.

Syntax
while condition:
    statement(s)

Example
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

Potential Danger

while loops can become infinite loops if the condition never becomes False.

3. LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS
A) break

Exits the loop immediately.

Example
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

B) continue

Skips the current iteration and continues the loop.

Example
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)

C) pass

Does nothing — used as a placeholder.

Example
for i in range(5):
    pass

4. Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop.

Example:
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(i, j)

5. Useful Loop Patterns
A) Sum of first n numbers
s = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    s += i
print(s)

B) Reverse Counting
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)

6. Real-Life Example
Printing a multiplication table
num = 5

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(num, "x", i, "=", num*i)

7. Difference Between for and while
for Loop	while Loop
Used when number of iterations is known	Used when number of iterations is unknown
Iterates over sequences	Runs until condition becomes False
Less chance of infinite loop	Higher chance of infinite loop
8. Infinite Loop Example (DON’T DO THIS)
while True:
    print("Hello")


This keeps running forever because the condition is always True.
