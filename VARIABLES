Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

ExampleGet your own Python Server
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
Casting
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

Example
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
Case-Sensitive
Variable names are case-sensitive.
Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:

A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
